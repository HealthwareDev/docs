# Introduction

> Understand general concepts, response codes, and authentication strategies.

## Base URL

The Healthware.dev API is built on **REST** principles. We enforce **HTTPS** in every request to improve data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support **HTTP**.

All requests contain the following base URL:

```
https://api.healthware.dev
```

## Authentication

To authenticate you need to add an *Authorization* header with the contents of the header being `Bearer re_xxxxxxxxx` where `key_xxxxxxxxx` is your [API Key](https://developer.healthware.dev/api-keys).

```
Authorization: Bearer key_xxxxxxxxx
```

## Response codes

Resend uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests.

In general, `2xx` HTTP codes correspond to success, `4xx` codes are for user-related failures, and `5xx` codes are for infrastructure issues.

| Status | Description                             |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `200`  | Successful request.                     |
| `400`  | Check that the parameters were correct. |
| `401`  | The API key used was missing.           |
| `403`  | The API key used was invalid.           |
| `404`  | The resource was not found.             |
| `429`  | The rate limit was exceeded.            |
| `5xx`  | Indicates an error with Healthware.dev servers. |

## Rate limit

The default maximum rate limit is **2 requests per second**. This number can be increased for trusted senders by request. After that, you'll hit the rate limit and receive a `429` response error code.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do you guarantee the availability of all biomarker data?">
   We can’t guarantee that all data returned from a user’s wearable will include every field. It’s important to implement logic that gracefully handles null or missing values.

  <Accordion title="How do you handle API versioning?">
    Currently, there's no versioning system in place. We plan to add versioning
    via calendar-based headers in the future.
