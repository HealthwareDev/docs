<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure providers">
    Once you’re registered, navigate to the **Providers** page to choose the wearables you’d like to support. Most integrations are one-click and fully managed by [Healthware.dev](http://Healthware.dev), but a few brands, such as WHOOP, require a quick setup step on the provider’s dashboard. If extra configuration is needed, you’ll see clear instructions to guide you through it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure destinations">
    Head over to the **Destinations** page to tell [Healthware.dev](http://Healthware.dev) where to deliver your data. By default, every event—real-time metrics, auth callbacks, and more is posted to the HTTPS webhook you specify (POST only). Need data in other places? Just add additional destinations such as message queues, cloud storage, or analytics pipelines to fit your workflow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect a wearable">
    With providers selected and destinations ready, you can now link a user’s wearable. Choose the flow that fits your app:

    **1. Manual OAuth flow**

    - Send a POST

      <ParamField path="/authorize/{provider}" type="string">
        **Manual OAuth flow**—ideal when you want to design and manage the entire authorisation experience yourself.
      </ParamField>
    - We return an auth_url.
    - Open that URL in the user’s browser to finish authorisation.

    **2. Fully-managed OAuth flow**

    - Send a POST

      <ParamField path="/integrations/token" type="string">
        The managed flow opens a unified session where users can select and authorise their preferred wearable.
      </ParamField>
    - Redirect the user to \*\*/api/integrations/token. \*\*Our hosted page walks them through the rest.

    Both flows complete the OAuth handshake and start streaming data to every destination you’ve configured.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write your first rules">
    With your providers selected, destinations enabled, and users connected, you’re ready to create **rules** logic blocks that fire whenever their conditions evaluate to true. Whenever a wearable sends fresh health data (Sleep, Recovery, HRV, etc.), [Healthware.dev](http://Healthware.dev):

    1. **Evaluates your rules.** Any rule that matches is triggered.
    2. **Performs an action** that you configured in the rules

    > **Always-on stream:** Real-time health data is still posted to your default webhook even if no rules match or exist, so you never miss an event.
  </Step>
</Steps>
