<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure providers">
    Once you’re registered, navigate to the **Providers** page to choose the wearables you’d like to support. Most integrations are one-click and fully managed by [Healthware.dev](http://Healthware.dev), but a few brands, such as WHOOP, require a quick setup step on the provider’s dashboard. If extra configuration is needed, you’ll see clear instructions to guide you through it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure destinations">
    Head over to the **Destinations** page to tell [Healthware.dev](http://Healthware.dev) where to deliver your data. By default, every event—real-time metrics, auth callbacks, and more is posted to the HTTPS webhook you specify (POST only). Need data in other places? Just add additional destinations such as message queues, cloud storage, or analytics pipelines to fit your workflow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect a wearable">
    With providers selected and destinations ready, you can now link a user’s wearable. Choose the flow that fits your app:

    **1. Manual OAuth flow**

    - Send a POST

      <ParamField path="/authorize/{provider}" type="string">
        **Manual OAuth flow**—ideal when you want to design and manage the entire authorisation experience yourself.
      </ParamField>
    - We return an auth_url.
    - Open that URL in the user’s browser to finish authorisation.

    **2. Fully-managed OAuth flow**

    - Send a POST

      <ParamField path="/integrations/token" type="string">
        The managed flow opens a unified session where users can select and authorise their preferred wearable.
      </ParamField>
    - Redirect the user to **/api/integrations/token. **Our hosted page walks them through the rest.

    Both flows complete the OAuth handshake and start streaming data to every destination you’ve configured.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write your first rules">
    With your providers selected, destinations enabled, and users connected, you’re ready to create **rules** logic blocks that fire whenever their conditions evaluate to true. Whenever a wearable sends fresh health data (Sleep, Recovery, HRV, etc.), [Healthware.dev](http://Healthware.dev):

    1. **Evaluates your rules.** Any rule that matches is triggered.
    2. **Performs an action** that you configured in the rules

    > **Always-on stream:** Real-time health data is still posted to your default webhook even if no rules match or exist, so you never miss an event.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Clone your docs locally" icon="github">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Preview changes" icon="rectangle-terminal">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally.

    1. Install the
       [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
       documentation changes locally with this command: `npm i -g mintlify`
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
       `docs.json` is): `mintlify dev`

    <Note>
      If you’re currently using the legacy `mint.json` configuration file, please update the Mintlify CLI:

      `npm i -g mintlify@latest`
      And run the new upgrade command in your docs repository:

      `mintlify upgrade`
      You should now be using the new `docs.json` configuration file. Feel free to delete the `mint.json` file from your repository.
    </Note>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Install our Github app" icon="message-bot">
    Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
    don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
    your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
    successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
    of the repo.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Push your changes" icon="rocket">
    [Commit and push your changes to
    Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
    for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
    the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
    update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
  </Accordion>
