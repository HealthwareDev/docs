## What is tracked in readiness

| **Data**               | **Units**      | **Description**                                                                         |
| :--------------------- | :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **hrv**                | ms             | Root-mean-square of successive differences (heart-rate-variability)                     |
| **hrv_samples**        | ms (array)     | A dense series of individual HRV measurements                                           |
| **resting_heart_rate** | breaths/min    | Average breathing rate per minute (provider may label this “resting heart rate”)        |
| **skin_temperature**   | °C             | Body skin temperature                                                                   |
| **readiness_score**    | score (varies) | Provider-specific recovery/readiness score (scale determined by each wearable platform) |
