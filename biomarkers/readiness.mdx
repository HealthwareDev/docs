## What is tracked in readiness

| **Data**               | **Units**      | **Description**                                                                           |
| :--------------------- | :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **hrv**                | ms             | Root-mean-square of successive differences (heart-rate-variability)                       |
| **hrv_samples**        | ms (array)     | Dense series of individual HRV measurements                                               |
| **resting_heart_rate** | breaths / min  | Average breathing rate per minute (provider may label this “resting heart rate”)          |
| **skin_temperature**   | °C             | Body skin temperature                                                                     |
| **readiness_score**    | score (varies) | Provider-specific recovery / readiness score (scale determined by each wearable platform) |
