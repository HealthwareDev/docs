## Why Healthware.dev

Consumers today are drowning in health data: sleep scores, heart-rate stats, HRV, strain. Yet most wearable apps resemble trading dashboards—dense, confusing, and built for analysts, not humans.

Despite these data points, behaviour change hasn’t followed. Why? Because metrics without context don’t drive action.

We are building an API and rules engine that turns raw wearable data into real-time nudges that drive healthy behaviour. We help developers go from metrics to meaning in minutes, without building their own AI or data pipelines.
